# React Native Shop

This application implements basic e-shop logic with the usage of React Native technology. 

It integrates with react-navigation, so it has a drawer, tab and stack navigation.

Data is fetched from firebase, but there is no client-changing logic, so shop items are kinda "immutable" :)

Start this project by running:
`react-native run-ios`
or 
`react-native run-android`

Good luck with that.
